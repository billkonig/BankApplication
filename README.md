# BankApplication
Program to simulate the actions of an online banking application.  With this program, the user can register as a customer of the bank and 
log in and log out at will using identity verification, create as many checking/savings accounts as they please, make as many deposits to or withdrawals from any of those  accounts as they please, and transfer funds between any of those accounts as much as they please.  Every transaction is recorded within each of its accounts, and can be viewed by accessing that account's full details which are readily available to view by the customer at any time, as well as just the balance of those accounts, if so desired by the customer.  The customer can also close any of their accounts at any time.  Runs through logIn.jsp.
